## Intelligent Hand Sign Recognition and Linguistic Translation System

📌 *Overview*

This project is a comprehensive system that performs real-time recognition of American Sign Language (ASL) gestures using computer vision and then translates them into corresponding alphabet letters and meaningful words or phrases. It combines hand tracking, gesture classification, sentence construction, and voice output to facilitate smooth communication for individuals with hearing or speech impairments.

🎯 *Features*

Real-time detection and recognition of ASL hand gestures

Letter-by-letter conversion and dynamic sentence construction

Speech synthesis for linguistic translation

Integrated with YOLOv8, DeepSORT, and MediaPipe for high accuracy

GUI-based interface for interaction and feedback

🛠️ *Technologies Used*

Python

YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)

MediaPipe

DeepSORT

Tkinter

pyttsx3 (text-to-speech)

OpenCV
